# Raycasting Engine

## Description

This project is my attempt at replicating the mechanisms behind the creation of early pseudo-3D games such as Wolfenstein 3D . It uses Java Swing for the graphical interface, ensuring real-time updates and smooth interactions. Rays are cast from the player's viewpoint to detect walls and obstacles, with trigonometric functions calculating angles and distances. A game loop continuously updates the game state for real-time player movement and interactions. Collision detection ensures accurate rendering by checking intersections between the player and the grid-based map.

here are images demonstrating how the program works.

### Dependencies
This project requires the following dependencies:

* Java Development Kit (JDK)
* Java Swing

Make sure you have the JDK installed and properly configured on your system, as well as the Java Swing library, which is typically included with the JDK.

### Executing program

* Simply run the Main.java file and enjoy :).
* For controls, use W A S D to move around and the left and right arrows to look around, or click m to toggle looking around using the mouse. You can also shoot the stick figures or the doors by clicking the left mouse button.
